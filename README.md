# **DEAL**

**Data Efficient Active Learning for Machine Learning Potentials**

DEAL selects non-redundant structures from atomistic trajectories via Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP), to be used to train machine-learning interatomic potentials.

The method is described in:

> **Perego S. & Bonati L.**
> *Data efficient machine learning potentials for modeling catalytic reactivity via active learning and enhanced sampling*,
> **npj Computational Materials 10, 291 (2024)**
> doi: [10.1038/s41524-024-01481-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01481-6)

## Highlights

* Select structures based on SGP predictive variance. 
* Analyze selected structures (e.g. along the trajectory or as a function of a CV)

```

3. Install DEAL

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luigibonati/DEAL.git

pip install .
```



---

## 🧪 Usage

DEAL can be run either with a command-line tool (`deal`) or using the python class (`DEAL`).

---


### 🟢 Minimal example

```bash
deal --file traj.xyz --threshold 0.1
```

DEAL will automatically:

* detect atomic species from the first frame
* use default GP/kernel/descriptor parameters
* use default output names


### 📄 With a YAML config file

For more customization you can create an `input.yaml` file:

```bash
deal -c input.yaml
```

```yaml
data:
  files: ["traj.xyz"]     # can be a single file or a list of files
  format: "extxyz"        # file format (e.g. extxyz, xyz, ...)
  index: ":"              # frame selection (e.g. ":", "0:100", [0,10,20]) [see ASE notation]
  colvar: "COLVAR"        # collective variables file associated with the trajectory (optional, used for monitoring CVs in chemiscope)
  shuffle: False          # whether to shuffle the frames before processing (suggested true for MD data)
  seed: 42

deal:
  threshold: 0.1         #can be a single value or a list of values
  update_threshold: 0.08 # if not set it is chosen as 0.8 * threshold 
  max_atoms_added: 0.15  # limit the number of selected environments added per configuration (can be int (number of atoms) or float (0,1) (fraction of total atoms). Default: -1 (no limit)
  initial_atoms: 0.2     # use up to 20% of the atoms of each species for GP initialization
  output_prefix: deal    # prefix for output files (threshold will be appended as suffix)
  force_only: true
  train_hyps: false      # whether to re-train hyperparameters at each iteration (slower) 
  verbose: true          # allowed values: true/false/"debug" (default: false)
  save_gp: false

flare_calc:
  gp: SGP_Wrapper        # (see flare's documentation)
  kernels:
    - name: NormalizedDotProduct
      sigma: 2 
      power: 2
  descriptors:
    - name: B2
      nmax: 8
      lmax: 3
      cutoff_function: cosine
      radial_basis: chebyshev
  cutoff: 4.5
```

### 🐍 Python Usage

```python
# Import 
from deal import DataConfig, DEALConfig, FlareConfig, DEAL

# Define Config (uses defaults where not provided)
data_cfg = DataConfig(files="traj.xyz")
deal_cfg = DEALConfig(
    threshold=0.1,
    output_prefix="deal",    
)
flare_cfg = FlareConfig()

# Instantiate DEAL class
deal = DEAL(data_cfg, deal_cfg, flare_cfg)

# Run 
deal.run()

```

### Output files

In both cases the following files (with the default `output_prefix=deal`):

1. **`deal_selected.xyz` – selected frames** 

Contains the atomic configurations where the GP uncertainty exceeded the threshold.
Includes atoms.info["frame"] indicating the original trajectory index.

2. **`deal_chemiscope.json.gz` – chemiscope visualization file**

Can be viewed online at https://chemiscope.org/ or inside Python:
```python
import chemiscope
chemiscope.show_input('deal_chemiscope.json.gz')
```

### Multiple thresholds

If the CLI receives a list of thresholds, DEAL will run once per threshold.
```yaml
deal:
  threshold:
    - 0.10
    - 0.15
    - 0.20
```

Equivalent behaviour in Python:

```python
for thr in [0.10, 0.15, 0.20]:
    deal_cfg.threshold = thr
    deal_cfg.output_prefix = f"run_thr{thr}"
    DEAL(data_cfg, deal_cfg, flare_cfg).run()
```

## 🎛️ Choice of the parameters

**Descriptors**

Local environments are characterized via the Atomic Cluster Expansion formalism as implemented in `flare`. Key hyperparameters: body order (`B1/B2`), radial degree `nmax`, angular degree `lmax`, and `cutoff` (in Å).

```yaml
  descriptors:
    - name: B2
      nmax: 8
      lmax: 3
      cutoff_function: cosine
      radial_basis: chebyshev
  cutoff: 4.5
```      

**Threshold**
```yaml
  threshold: 0.1
  update_threshold: 0.08  # if not set it is chosen as 0.8 * threshold      
  max_atoms_added: -1 # no limit on the number of selected environment of a given configuration to the GP.
  initial_atoms: 0.15 # use up to 15% of the atoms (of each species) for GP initialization
```      

The`threshold` parameter in the DEAL configuration controls when a local environment is flagged by the SGP’s predictive variance (normalized by the noise hyperparameter). If any environment exceeds the threshold, the GP is updated and that environment (plus any others above `update_threshold * threshold`, up to `max_atoms_added`) is added. 

Some tips:

- A good starting point is around 0.1. As a rule of thumb, homogeneous, condensed and/or crystalline systems tend to have fewer different local environments and require smaller thresholds (<<0.1), whereas heterogeneous systems may require larger ones (>0.1).
- Try a few values and compare how many structures are selected; distributions often are very similar across thresholds, what changes is the number of structures.
- For active learning of ML potentials, a possible practical strategy is to pick an initial threshold (large for quickly covering all configurations), run the single-point calculations on the selected structure, and update the potential. Then, re-evaluate the already screened configuration (all) and, if it is not adequately described, restart DEAL selection with a tighter threshold. 
Given the generally low cost of ML simulations, it is still advisable to perform a greater number of AL-cycles rather than re-evaluating existing structures, as the newly generated structures are expected to be more relevant as generated by an increasingly accurate interatomic potential.
