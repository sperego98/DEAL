## $N_2$ decomposition on FeCo

- Ref.: Perego and Bonati, *npj Computational Materials* 10, 291 (2024), doi: [10.1038/s41524-024-01481-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01481-6)
- Data: Nitrogen dissociation on FeCo(110) surface, collected via OPES enhanced sampling simulations.
- Summary: 
    1. pre-select high uncertainty configurations based on ensemble-based standard deviation
    2. filter them using the GP predictive variance to identify structurally different configurations
    3. analyze distribution of selected CVs
